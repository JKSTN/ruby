i looked at a few tutorials, i found this one to be the best place to start learning.

It seems to have excersizes, all .rb files you can do here.

I Think there isn't, but if there's an online interpretor for ruby, don't use it. Make a file and execute it from command line.


After you've done these, we'd work on more coding excersizes.

Codes away.
