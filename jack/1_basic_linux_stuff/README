For all tasks below, work ONLY on command line, as if front-end interface doesn't exist for you.
You can open it to check that it works ofcourse, but not create file etc.

1. In your home directory, create a folder called apps.
2. Git Clone your ruby repository in the home folder
3. Move the ruby folder into apps/
4. Navigate to this folder (1_basic_linux_stuff) and create a file testing.rb
5. Open this file in sublime (you may have to setup command line way of opening sublime before this)
6. write code so that this file prints What's Up
7. Run the file and check output if it's correct
8. in apps/ruby/1_basic_linux_stuff .. create a folder called testing1
9. Similar to above, create another file testing1.rb which prints, 'I can do this'
10. Go back to apps/ruby, and write a command that runs this file (while sitting in the apps/ruby folder)
11. delete the file testing.rb
12. delete the folder testing1
